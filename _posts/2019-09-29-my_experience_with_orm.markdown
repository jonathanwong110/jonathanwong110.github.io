Initially, when I started on the ORM section, it was really confusing and hard to get the hang of it. I would also hear a lot of SQL but I never had any personal experience with it until now. After a while, I was beginning to understand it.

One thing I did to help me get a better understanding, was visualizing the code I was writing to fit into a table (i.e. Excel). Specifically, laying out the rows and columns, and how data was going to input into the tables.

I have to say, near the end of the ORM portion, I think was the first time I saw "magic" meaning code that was ubiquitous to write column names, values to input for said columns, and so on.
